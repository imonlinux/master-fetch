## ✨ Why Hound

Hound is one [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives any agent (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Hermes, Pi, anything that speaks MCP) full web research from a single local process. Six tools, one warm browser, zero accounts.

| | |
|---|---|
| 🆓 **$0 forever, MIT** | No keys, no accounts, no per-request billing, no data sent to a third-party scraper. Search is keyless and local too. |
| 🧠 **Mastered on connect** | A one-time `instructions` block gives the agent the mental model + the #1 workflow + the known limits. Effective on turn one, not turn ten. |
| 📐 **~2.5K tokens, 6 tools** | Hand-crafted tool defs, no Pydantic schema bloat. More capability than tools shipping 5K+. |
| 🎯 **Every response is actionable** | `content_ok`, `next_action`, `summary`, `relevance_score`, `fetch_relevance`. Agents branch on structured fields, not error text. |

> Hound is for the agent itself. You install it once; the agent calls it whenever it needs the web.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
pip install hound-mcp[all]          # fetch + crawl + keyless search + PDF + OCR + neural rerank
playwright install chromium         # the anti-detect browser engine
```

```bash
hound -v        # version + update status
hound -u        # update to latest
```

Then point any MCP client at the `hound` command. No arguments, no keys, no env vars. See **[Install](#-install)** for the lean option + **[Tell your agent to install it](#-tell-your-agent-to-install-it)** for a copy-paste prompt.

## 🧰 The 6 tools

| Tool | One-liner |
|------|-----------|
| `smart_fetch` | Fetch any URL. HTTP first, auto-escalates to the anti-detect browser if blocked. Bulk, PDFs (with OCR + quality score), `css_selector`, `focus`, `actions`, pagination. |
| `smart_crawl` | Best-first same-domain crawl. Each page as markdown with `content_ok` + `page_type` (article / list / js_shell). `discover_only`, `crawl_urls`, `focus`, time + token caps. |
| `smart_search` | Local keyless web search. Scrapes DuckDuckGo + Bing in parallel (add `google`/`wikipedia`), merges + ranks. `relevance_score` + `fetch_relevance` per result. Keyword / neural / find_similar. Returns URLs + ranking (the agent fetches the ones it wants). `engine_blocked` shows engines that didn't contribute. |
| `screenshot` | Capture a page as an image. For multimodal agents (canvas, image-of-text, visual layout). Session auto-managed. |
| `cache_clear` | Clear the fetch cache. `all=true` wipes everything. |
| `version` | Installed version + update status. |

<details>
<summary><b>📖 Full tool reference</b></summary>

**`smart_fetch`** — Fetch any URL with full content extraction. Auto HTTP → stealthy escalation. Bulk via `urls`. Narrow with `css_selector`. PDFs auto-extracted to structured markdown (tables, headings, metadata); `pages='1-5'` for a subset; scanned PDFs AND CID-corrupted fonts auto-OCR with `[all]`. Response carries `quality_score` (0–1), `table_of_contents`, `metadata`. `focus='query'` returns only BM25-relevant blocks. `actions` for click/fill/scroll. Paginate with `offset`. Signals: `content_ok`, `next_action`, `summary`, `is_truncated`+`next_offset`. `cache_ttl=0` bypasses cache.

**`smart_crawl`** — Best-first walk of same-domain links. Content-adaptive: article/docs → main content; list/index pages → structured link list; JS shells → detected + reported. `discover_only=true` → URL map. `crawl_urls=[...]` → second-phase selective crawl. `focus` prioritizes + filters. Caps: `max_pages` (10), `max_depth` (2), `max_total_chars`, `deadline_ms` (120000). Per-page `content_ok` + `status` (network error = −1) + `fetched_at`. Reuses `smart_fetch` anti-bot + cache.

**`smart_search`** — Scrapes DuckDuckGo + Bing in parallel (add `google` or `wikipedia`), merges, dedups by normalized URL, ranks. Returns URLs + ranking, not page content (the agent `smart_fetch`es the ones it wants). Filters: `site`/`exclude_sites`, `location`/`language`/`region`, `page`, `freshness`. Modes: `auto` (neural if `[all]`+model present else keyword BM25), `keyword`, `neural` (local ONNX cross-encoder on snippets), `find_similar` (pass `url=`). `engine_blocked` lists engines that didn't contribute (rate-limited/timed out/no results).

## 🔎 Local keyless search

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dondai1234/master-fetch/master/docs/hound-scene.png" alt="Hound fetches the web and brings it back to your agent" width="820">
</div>

No API key, no account, no third-party service. `smart_search` scrapes **DuckDuckGo + Bing** in parallel (add `google` or `wikipedia`), merges, dedups, and ranks on your machine. It returns URLs + ranking, **not page content** — the agent `smart_fetch`es the 1–2 that matter instead of all 9. Every result carries `relevance_score` (0–1) and `fetch_relevance` (**high** / **med** / **low**).

**Three rerank modes:**
- **`keyword`** — BM25 over title + snippet. Baseline, always available, even on the lean install.
- **`neural`** — a local ONNX cross-encoder (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`, Apache-2.0) running on the `onnxruntime` Hound already ships for OCR. Exa-style semantic ranking, $0, on your machine. The model downloads once (~80MB, cached, not bundled).
- **`find_similar`** — pass `url=`; Hound fetches a page you like, derives a query, and reranks candidates against that source page. Exa's find-similar, local.

`smart_search` returns URLs + ranking only — the agent `smart_fetch`es the results it wants (one extra call beats guessing which URL is worth fetching). Default 9 results. `google` is opt-in (it often CAPTCHAs/consents; when it does it shows up in `engine_blocked` so you know, instead of silently contributing nothing). `wikipedia` is opt-in too (off by default — its results were usually tangential).

### 🛡️ Search Engine Resilience Layer

Scraping public engines from your IP can be rate-limited or CAPTCHA'd. No keyless local tool is bulletproof against sustained blocking without a proxy — Hound is honest about that, and then makes the no-proxy case as robust as possible for a single user:

| # | Mechanism | What it does |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Persistent warm session per engine** | One long-lived session reused across searches — cookies + TLS accumulate, so the engine sees a returning human, not a fresh bot. Also faster (no per-search TLS handshake). |
| 2 | **Per-engine pacing + jitter** | Within one search all engines fire in parallel (free); only same-engine bursts across searches get a small jittered delay. |
| 3 | **Circuit breaker + cooldown** | A blocked engine auto-cools (15 → 120s) while the others keep serving. Results keep flowing. |
| 4 | **202 / 429 / 503 / 403 + Retry-After** | DDG's HTTP 202 soft rate-limit is detected; `Retry-After` honored. |
| 5 | **Fingerprint rotation** | A pool of real Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Safari TLS profiles, picked per request. |
| 6 | **Adaptive Google reserve tier** | Google (most CAPTCHA-prone) fires via the stealthy browser only when the primaries fall short. |
| 7 | **`HOUND_SEARCH_PROXY`** | Route all engine requests through your own rotating / residential proxy — the bulletproof path for heavy use. |

`engine_blocked` in the response tells the agent which engines are cooling down (retry shortly). Same gray-area posture as SearXNG / ddgs; no search-engine ToS compliance is claimed.

## ⚙️ How it works

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dondai1234/master-fetch/master/docs/flow.svg" alt="Hound pipeline: HTTP to stealthy escalation, extract, agent-optimized response; PDF and crawl branches" width="760">
</div>

- `smart_fetch` checks cache + robots, tries HTTP, escalates to the stealthy Patchright browser on a block / JS-shell / 403 / 503, then extracts + enriches. PDFs branch to pdfplumber (with CID-garbage + scanned auto-OCR via pypdfium2 + rapidocr, `quality_score`, ToC). `smart_crawl` reuses the same pipeline across a same-domain best-first walk.
- `smart_search` scrapes engines in parallel (browser-impersonated HTTP, escalating to the warm stealthy browser if blocked), merges + dedups, then reranks (keyword / neural / find_similar).
- One stealthy Chrome is pre-warmed at startup and reused, so escalation skips the 3–5s cold start.
- Content over 40KB is chunked; the response gives `next_offset` so the agent pages through with one more call (served instantly from cache).

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Deep-dive: every feature</b></summary>

#### 📄 PDF + scanned-PDF OCR + CID-recovery
`smart_fetch` detects a PDF (by content-type **or** `%PDF` magic bytes) and extracts it to **structured markdown** with `pdfplumber` (MIT, no AGPL baggage): multi-column reading order, real **tables as markdown tables**, font-size headings, de-hyphenated paragraphs, a metadata header, and `--- Page N ---` markers. Pass `pages="1-5"` for a subset.

**The flagship trick — CID-corruption auto-OCR.** Academic papers embed font subsets without a Unicode map, so extractors emit `(cid:71)(cid:302)...` garbage for figures/diagrams/math. But the glyphs *render* correctly. Hound detects CID-garbage pages, renders them via `pypdfium2`, and OCRs them with `rapidocr`, recovering the real text automatically. Scanned / image-only PDFs (and image-only web pages) are auto-OCR'd too. Every PDF response carries `quality_score` (0.0–1.0) and an honest `content_ok`; `table_of_contents` from the PDF outline; `metadata` (title/author/dates); `include_media=true` for per-page image metadata; `password` for encrypted PDFs; a `.pdf` URL that returns a login/paywall is reported as `auth_required`. All pure-pip, no system binary, with `[all]`.

#### 🕷️ Deep crawl (`smart_crawl`)
Walk same-domain links in **best-first** order: discovered URLs are scored by focus relevance + content-likelihood (docs/guide/api boosted, login/submit/cart penalized) + shallow depth, so content pages are crawled before junk when the budget is tight. Extraction is **content-adaptive**: article/docs → trafilatura main content; list/index pages (HN, aggregators, directories) → a structured `* [title](url)` link list; JS shells → detected + reported honestly. URLs normalized so `/docs` and `/docs/` are never crawled twice. `discover_only=true` → URL map; `crawl_urls=[...]` → second-phase selective crawl; `path_include`/`path_exclude` to scope. Caps on pages / depth / tokens / time. Same-domain only by default.

#### 🛡️ Anti-bot + one warm browser
`smart_fetch` tries plain HTTP first (~1s). If the site blocks HTTP or serves a JS shell, it auto-escalates to a **Patchright** anti-detect browser with Cloudflare challenge solving. Two tiers, nothing to configure. The same warm stealthy browser is the search engine scraper's anti-bot tier: when an engine rate-limits or CAPTCHAs the HTTP scraper, Hound renders the results page in the warm browser and parses that. A single Chrome warms at startup and stays alive for the whole session; pages are closed after each fetch and resource loading is dropped, so idle memory stays near baseline.

#### 🎯 Query-focused extraction (`focus`)
`smart_fetch(url, focus="...")` returns only the BM25-relevant blocks (paragraphs, headings, tables). On a long page this cuts context 80%+ with no re-fetch (runs post-cache, so one cached page serves any focus query). Re-pass the same `focus` when paginating.

#### 🖱️ Page interaction (`actions`)
Content behind a click, a search form, a "load more", or infinite scroll:
`actions=[{click:"button.load-more"}, {fill:{selector:"#q", text:"x"}}, {press:"Enter"}, {wait:500}, {scroll:3}, {wait_selector:".item"}]`. Runs on the stealthy browser after load, before extraction. Forces stealthy + bypasses cache.

#### 🏷️ Metadata on every response
Structured `metadata` for citation + relevance: title, description, site name, type, image, canonical URL, language, published time, author (from OpenGraph, JSON-LD, the canonical link, and `<title>`).

#### 🐕 Reddit, optimized
Reddit URLs auto-rewrite to old.reddit.com (7× smaller pages) and skip straight to the stealthy browser (www.reddit.com walls HTTP). Subreddit listings parse into structured posts (title, score, comments, author, domain) from canonical data attributes, with promoted ads filtered out and sticky/NSFW posts tagged.

#### 💾 Smart caching
SQLite cache keyed by URL + extraction type + css_selector + pages (and by query + filters + mode for search). WAL mode for concurrent access. **Bad content is never cached** (JS shells, bot challenges, error statuses re-fetch instead of freezing broken pages). A size cap evicts the oldest entries so a long-lived agent's cache can't grow unbounded.

## 📊 Comparison: free tools

Hound is compared only to other **free** ways to give an agent web research. Only paid services (Bright Data, ZenRows, Firecrawl paid, Exa) can compete on hard anti-bot or hosted neural search at scale — and they cost money, require accounts, and route your data through their servers.

| | **Hound** | Crawl4AI | Jina Reader | Firecrawl (OSS / free) | DIY Playwright |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $0 forever | $0 (self-host) | free, rate-limited | $0 self-host / 1K free | $0 (your time) |
| **License** | MIT (no attribution) | Apache-2.0 (attribution) | proprietary | AGPL-ish / cloud | n/a |
| **Account / API key** | none | none | optional free key | cloud needs account + key | none |
| **Runs locally** | yes | yes | no (their API) | self-host: yes (Redis + Docker) | yes |
| **Anti-bot / Cloudflare** | built-in (Patchright) | limited | none | not by default | none |
| **Deep crawl** | yes (best-first, budget, map) | yes | no | yes (cloud) | build it |
| **PDF → structured markdown** | yes (tables, subset) | partial | yes (native) | yes (cloud + OCR) | build it |
| **Scanned-PDF / image OCR** | yes (rapidocr, pure-pip) | no | no | yes (cloud paid) | build it |
| **Page interaction** | yes (`actions`) | hooks (code) | no | yes (cloud) | build it |
| **Query-focused extraction** | yes (`focus`, BM25) | yes (BM25 filter) | no | no | build it |
| **Web search** | yes (keyless local) | no | yes | no | no |
| **Search rerank** | neural + find_similar | BM25 | none | none | n/a |
| **Search anti-bot** | yes (warm stealthy browser) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| **Agent signals** | yes (`content_ok`/`next_action`/`summary`/`relevance_score`) | no | no | no | no |
| **Connect-time `instructions`** | yes | no | no | no | no |
| **MCP server** | yes (official) | community | yes (official) | yes (official) | build it |
| **Token cost (tools/list)** | ~2.5K (6 tools) | varies | n/a | varies (12 tools) | n/a |

**Takeaway:** Crawl4AI is the closest free competitor (self-host Python, local, no key, has crawl + BM25), but no web search, no scanned-PDF OCR, no page interaction, no agent-optimized signals, and Apache-2.0 (attribution required) vs Hound's MIT. Jina Reader is the easiest (prefix a URL) and handles PDFs, but no anti-bot, no crawl, no interaction, no local search, routes through Jina's servers, rate-limited. Firecrawl's OSS has no anti-bot by default; the generous features live in the paid cloud. **Hound is the only free tool that combines crawl, built-in Cloudflare bypass, scanned-PDF OCR, page interaction, query-focused extraction, and keyless local search with neural + find-similar rerank — all local, MIT, $0, no accounts, no keys.**

<details>
<summary><b>When a paid service makes sense</b></summary>

Paid scrapers (Bright Data, ZenRows, Firecrawl paid, Spider.cloud) can beat free tools on the hardest anti-bot (DataDome, Akamai, Cloudflare Turnstile) and on massive scale, because they run large residential-proxy networks. Paid search APIs (Exa, Tavily) offer hosted neural search. They cost $16 to $500+/month, require accounts + API keys, and send your queries + content through their servers. Use Hound for $0 local web research with no accounts and no keys; reach for a paid service only for enterprise scale, sites Hound explicitly can't crack, or hosted neural search at scale.

## 🪙 Token cost

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dondai1234/master-fetch/master/docs/tokens.svg" alt="MCP tool count comparison: Hound 6 tools vs Firecrawl 12, Jina 19, Bright Data 60+" width="760">
</div>

Most MCP servers cost 3–5K tokens just to exist. Hound's 6 tools cost **~2.5K tokens**, and the connect-time `instructions` are injected once at handshake, not repeated every turn. Your context window is expensive; Hound respects it.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pip install hound-mcp[all]          # recommended: fetch + crawl + keyless search + PDF + OCR + neural rerank
playwright install chromium
```

<details>
<summary><b>Lean install (no neural rerank, no PDF/OCR)</b></summary>

```bash
pip install hound-mcp               # fetch + crawl + keyless keyword search
playwright install chromium
```

The lean install is fully functional: multi-engine keyless search with keyword BM25, anti-bot, crawl, fetch, caching. `[all]` adds the ONNX neural reranker, PDF extraction, and OCR (scanned PDFs + CID-recovery + image pages) on the same `onnxruntime`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Optional environment variables</b></summary>

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `HOUND_SEARCH_PROXY` | Route all search-engine requests through your own proxy (`http://host:port`, `socks5://...`, or `user:pass@host:port`). For sustained heavy search use with a rotating / residential proxy. Not required for normal single-user use. |
| `HOUND_SEARCH_MIN_INTERVAL` | Override the per-engine pacing floor (seconds, float). `0` = use the built-in defaults (DDG 1.2s, Bing 1.5s, Wikipedia 0.3s). Power-user tuning. |

No API keys or accounts are needed for anything — search is keyless and local.

## 🤖 Tell your agent to install it

Paste this into your agent:

```
Install the Hound MCP server on this machine. Follow every step. Do not skip any.

1. Figure out which agent harness you are running on (OpenCode, Hermes, Pi, etc). Then find: (a) where the MCP config file lives, and (b) what format it expects for adding a local MCP server. Read the harness docs if needed. Do not guess.

2. Run: pip install hound-mcp[all]
   Then run: playwright install chromium (But only if it isnt installed already, verify first about its existence)
   If either fails, stop and tell the user.

3. Find the MCP config file from step 1 and back it up before editing. Add a new MCP server named "hound" with command "hound", no arguments, in the format your harness requires. No API keys or environment variables are needed (search is keyless and local).

4. Save the file. Tell the user to restart the agent. After restart, smart_fetch, smart_crawl, smart_search, screenshot, cache_clear and version should be available.
```

<details>
<summary><b>For Pi agent users</b></summary>

```
Install the Hound MCP server. Follow every step. Do not skip any.

1. Run: pip install hound-mcp[all]
   Then run: playwright install chromium (But only if it isnt installed already, verify first about its existence)
   If either fails, stop and tell the user.

2. Check pi-mcp-adapter: pi list. If not installed: pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter

3. Backup ~/.pi/agent/mcp.json, then add this inside mcpServers:
   "hound": { "command": "hound", "transport": "stdio", "lifecycle": "eager" }
   No API keys or environment variables are needed (search is keyless and local).

4. Tell the user: "Run /reload, then /mcp to verify. smart_fetch, smart_crawl and smart_search should be available."
```

</details>

## ⚠️ Honest limits

No free tool can do everything. Hound is upfront about what it can't:

| Limit | What happens instead |
|-------|----------------------|
| **DataDome / Akamai / Cloudflare Turnstile (interactive)** | Not bypassed. `next_action` tells the agent to switch sources instead of retrying. |
| **Search rate-limits / CAPTCHAs** | Mitigated by the Resilience Layer (warm sessions, pacing, circuit breaker, multi-engine fallback, stealthy escalation); `engine_blocked` reports cooling engines. Same posture as SearXNG / ddgs. |
| **Neural / find_similar search** | Need `hound-mcp[all]` (the ONNX reranker runs on the same `onnxruntime` as OCR; model downloads once). Lean installs get keyword BM25. |
| **Sites requiring login** | Out of scope (Hound does page interaction, not authenticated sessions). |
| **Deep shadow-DOM / hard SPAs** | `actions` (scroll, click, `wait_selector`) reach most of it; deep shadow-DOM piercing not yet wired. |
| **YouTube** | Minimal text. |

When a fetch or search fails, the response says exactly why and what to try next — so the agent doesn't waste calls guessing.
