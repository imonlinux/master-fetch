# Changelog

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Default caching was OFF (cache_ttl=0). Now defaults to 3600s (1 hour). Repeat fetches return instantly from cache.
- Added 40KB content chunking with offset continuation. AI agents get a truncation notice when content exceeds the limit.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-01

- Streamable HTTP transport (--http flag) for remote agent connections
- Anti-bot bypass for DataDome, Akamai, Cloudflare challenges

- Domain extraction doesn't handle .co.uk / .com.au correctly
