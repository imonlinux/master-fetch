"""v8.2 startup-robustness tests.

The recurring 'hound failed to load' (50% of the time) was caused by heavy
module-level imports (trafilatura, the metasearch engine chain, mcp.server.
fastmcp) blocking the process for ~5s BEFORE the MCP initialize handshake could
respond — cold starts exceeded the client timeout. v8.2 defers all of them to
first use so the server starts in <1s and the handshake responds immediately.
Also: the browser prewarm is fully isolated (BaseException + timeout) and
shutdown is bulletproof (no 'Event loop is closed' crash).
